#Performing CRUD operations (dynamic mode)

In this repository you'll find stored procedures scripts that help you to perform CRUD operations by using Json.
Here you'll find stored procedures for:
    - update
    - insert
    - delete
    - select

These were made by using dynamic SQL. The main purpose was to improve the security of an app developed for a bank, reduce the number of variables for sending the values from app to database, reduce the programmer's time in integrating these procedures stored in the application code and also facilitate the possibility of making changes to the database.


Thank you :)
